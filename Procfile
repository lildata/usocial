# Heroku won't open more than one port per app
# so we use two apps instead with the same source code.
# $CMD:
# - npm run serve -- --scope usocial-client
# - npm run serve -- --scope usocial-api
# $CMD is an environment variable, just like $PORT or $REACT_APP_*
# Environment variables can be set through GUI or .env files
